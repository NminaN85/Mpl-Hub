    <h2>🎯 Why This Update Matters</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Reduce idle waiting time</li>

        <li>Enhance player endurance during wars</li>
        <li>Encourage more dynamic battle strategies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The game administration has consistently worked on improving various aspects of
        <strong>My Profit Land</strong>, including combat systems, resource management,
        and overall gameplay balance.
    </p>

    <p>
        This War Specialist upgrade reflects a continued effort to evolve the game
        and respond to the needs of competitive players.
    </p>

    <h2>📍 How to Activate the Upgrade</h2>

    <p>
        You can activate the new status through:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>My Weapons and Infos</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        From there, use <strong>SVCT</strong> to upgrade your War Specialist Status.
    </p>

    <h2>⚖️ Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
        With reduced cooldowns and increased drink limits,
        warfare in My Profit Land is becoming faster and more dynamic.
    </p>

        may gain a significant advantage in upcoming battles.
